### üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è How to Use

#### 1. Start the System
```bash
podman-compose up -d
```

#### 2. Check GPU Status
```bash
# Via API
curl http://localhost:5000/api/gpu-status

# Via Podman
podman exec debris_tracking_system-space-debris-tracker-1 python gpu_config.py
```

#### 3. Monitor Performance
- Visit `http://localhost:5000` for the web interface
- Check logs: `http://localhost:5000/api/logs`
- GPU utilization: `nvidia-smi` (on host system)

### üîç Troubleshooting

#### Common Issues & Solutions

1. **GPU Not Detected**
   - Ensure Podman with GPU support is enabled
   - Check NVIDIA drivers are up to date
   - Verify `nvidia-smi` works on host

2. **Out of Memory Errors**
   - Reduce `TF_GPU_MEMORY_FRACTION` (current: 0.8)
   - Enable memory growth (already configured)
   - Restart container: `podman-compose restart`

3. **Performance Not Improved**
   - Check if GPU is actually being used: `nvidia-smi`
   - Verify model is using GPU device: Check logs
   - Ensure data preprocessing isn't the bottleneck

#### Monitoring Commands
```bash
# Check container status
podman ps

# View application logs
podman logs debris_tracking_system-space-debris-tracker-1

# Test GPU functionality
podman exec debris_tracking_system-space-debris-tracker-1 python test_gpu.py

# Monitor GPU usage
watch -n 1 nvidia-smi
```
